//A mathematics teacher asks students to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius. 
// The value of π (PI) should not change, so it must be stored in a constant. If the radius is 5, write a program to calculate and display the area.

const PI = 22/7
let radius = 5
let Area = PI * radius**2
console.log('The area of the circle is '+ Area)
