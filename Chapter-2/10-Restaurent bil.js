 //A restaurant’s billing system stores the food bill as a string (for example, "200"), but the tip is stored as a number (50). 
 // Write a program that adds them together and shows the result, then discuss why the total looks unusual.
let food_bill = "200"; 
let tip = 50;
let totalBill = food_bill + tip;
console.log("Total Bill: " + totalBill); // Output: 20050
