//Endless Greeting
//Write a program that accidentally prints “Welcome!” endlessly. Then explain why it never stops and how to fix it. The explanation should mention that the loop keeps running because the condition never changes and suggest a way to update the condition so the loop stops.

while (true) {
    console.log("Welcome!");
}
