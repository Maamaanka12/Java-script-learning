    <p>Fatima is shopping online. She adds two products to her cart: a Phone priced at $800 and Headphones priced at $200.

        However, by mistake, the items are placed in the wrong variables, so the program should swap their positions.

        The system must then display her shopping cart details in a clear sentence using template literals.

        Next, the system calculates the total price and applies a discount using if–else conditions:

        If the total is more than $1000, apply a 20% discount.

        If the total is between $500 and $1000, apply a 10% discount.

        Otherwise, no discount is applied.
